As part of the project, students should: 
1) carefully choose a website to scrap data from it, 
2) collect data from the website using the tools presented during the course, 
3) prepare the collected data for further analysis, and 
4) submit a report documenting the entire process.

The assessment shall be based on: 
1) choice of the website - scraping must be legal and ethical, respecting the website owners' preferences, 
2) use of tools presented during the course - students are expected to use all three libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium, 
3) technical correctness of the application of the aforementioned tools, 
4) efficiency of the proposed solution, 
5) preparation of the data for further analysis, 
6) structure, readability, and clarity of the report.

Jupyter Notebook form of the report is preferred.
Deadlines for submitting the projects: April 08, 2025 (first take), September 14, 2025 (second take).
Presentation of the project guidelines

- No other presentation dates in the first take are planned.
- Dates for presentations in the second take will be announced if needed.

Final test information
- The test will consist of 20 multiple-choice questions, with answer options A, B, and C.
- Each answer can be either correct or incorrect, meaning all answers can be correct, all can be incorrect, or any combination of correct and incorrect answers is possible.
- A fully correct answer earns 2 points. A partially correct answer earns from 0.2 to 0.4 points, depending on how much was missing for a fully correct response. Obviously, an opposite to a correct answer earns no points.
